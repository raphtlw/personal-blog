Over the past year of using Linux daily, i've discovered many ways to improving battery life and thermal efficiency on my Linux laptop and I would like to share those tips with you. I'm daily driving a Surface Laptop 2 with Arch Linux and it's been great so far. The only drawback I faced after installing Linux was the battery life. It wasn't bad, but I felt that it could definitely do better. Linux isn't configured by the manufacturers who make laptops so you'll need to do the changes yourself. Hopefully, this guide will help you with everything you need to get great battery life on Linux laptops. This guide doesn't only apply to Arch Linux. It applies to **all** Linux distros out there.

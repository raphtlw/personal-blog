Hey guys, welcome to my blog. I've been contemplating about starting a blog for a while now, each time I think of it I would just be procrastinating about it. Anyway, here I would like to just talk about personal development, time management, and the concept of a "second brain". I usually write about Linux, open source, and things of that nature. Thanks for sticking around and I hope you'll enjoy it!

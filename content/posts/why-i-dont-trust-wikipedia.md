Wikipedia is beyond repair. In the past, Wikipedia used to be a whole repository of information which people who specialize in the topics contribute to. It was a place that everyone could go and look for useful information. These days, Wikipedia has become just a repository of the mainstream media. Here's why.

First of all, I want to explain some of the problems with mainstream media and how it relates to me not using Wikipedia. The journalists who write articles on the mainstream media only do a little bit of research to make you believe what they spin up using the little things that they know about a particular topic or event. The things they know are not the full story or even the truth at all; and everyone knows that. Everyone knows that journalists are morons. You can (and should) go on Twitter and see what journalists think&mdash;they're crazy. People who read the news suffer from this effect called the Murray Gell-Mann effect. What is the Gell-Mann effect? Named after famous physicist Murray Gell-Mann, the Amnesia Effect was coined by Jurassic Park author Michael Crichton to describe the act of feeling skeptical as you read a magazine or newspaper article about an area in which you have expertise and then completely forgetting that skepticism as you turn the page and read about something you know less about.

For example, if you are a programmer and specialize in computer science, and you read an article on that field, like "Why Microsoft's development workflow is ineffiecient", you immediately know that the article is bullshit, that it doesn't cover the full story, and that most of it is wrong. What usually happens, almost 100% of the time, is that journalist who wrote that article knows nothing about the topic, and only wrote the article through skimming sources online. They don't know anything about any specialized topic or really, anything at all. You will realize that this journalist has totally understood issues backwards; they get basic terms wrong, they get specialized information wrong. When the same person reads another article on for example, India or Donald Trump, they immediately take it at face value, believing whatever the article says. This is the Gell-Mann effect.

Here's Michael Crichton explaining it:

> Briefly stated, the Gell-Mann Amnesia effect is as follows. You open the newspaper to an article on some subject you know well. In Murray’s case, physics. In mine, show business. You read the article and see the journalist has absolutely no understanding of either the facts or the issues. Often, the article is so wrong it actually presents the story backward — reversing cause and effect. I call these the “wet streets cause rain” stories. Paper’s full of them.
>
> In any case, you read with exasperation or amusement the multiple errors in a story, and then turn the page to national or international affairs, and read as if the rest of the newspaper was somehow more accurate about Palestine than the baloney you just read. You turn the page, and forget what you know.

The Gell-Mann effect tells us a lot about the news media. The journalists who write the news articles only use the real information as sort of a "playground" to tell stories that are based on what they think. They take the information that is available out there, and pluck the things that they know and put it in the articles, presenting it in a way that seems unbiased and true, according to the journalists who have done the "fact checking".

Wikipedia is just a repository of media biases these days. It relies so much on journalists and doesn't like professional opinions. It has a bias for people (aka journalists) who don't know much about a topic and just write based on what they think. They do it in a flat tone that it makes you just think that whatever they write is real and true. Wikipedia doesn't like original research. It doesn't like original information. The journalists are basically in control of Wikipedia and everything it presents.

[This](https://larrysanger.org/2020/05/wikipedia-is-badly-biased/) article written by Larry Sanger, the co-founder of Wikipedia himself states that Wikipedia no longer has an "effective neutrality policy". He talks about the problems with Wikipedia and how badly biased it has become. It also contains many many examples on Wikipedia's biases and goes in depth on the issues and problems with it.

The difference between Wikipedia and the news media is tone. Wikipedia states what it wants you to believe in a neutral tone. They do it in such a way that they turn what journalists say about a topic and rearrange it that it seems unbiased. Articles on Wikipedia pretend to have no point of view. The news media however, doesn't pretend to have no point of view. They too use a flat tone to report things, but they state what people are thinking (which is what they want you to believe), and they claim that they are trying to be objective and stuff. The only difference between Wikipedia and the news media is that Wikipedia takes whatever the news says, and sort of "cleans it up" and present it nicely to the reader, stating things in a way that it is what it is.

If you think about it, the news media had to invent "fact checkers". These "fact checkers" are just the same journalists that are writing the lies in the news, writing the "facts" in a more "objective" tone. There is a difference between saying something objectively and presenting things well—looking at things from different perspectives according to the truth.

People have problems distinguishing a flat tone (don't have any emotions in the affair) that is biased from real facts. You can go on Twitter and just see what journalists think; they're crazy.

I don't trust Wikipedia any more than the media anymore. Wikipedia is filled with the same content that is on the news, where they expect you to take things at face value. The Wikipedia editors and the news editors know very well that you can lie with the truth. If you word a sentence in just the right way, you can tell people things that are truths, but you can lead them into a lie. This is something the media has perfected, and Wikipedia has, too. Wikipedia has turned into a place where biases are centralized. It is filled with opinions of Wikipedia editors and the journalists who are writing the news articles in the news media.

We are all liable for what we know. We can get things wrong but I don't think you should rely on a stupid authority to tell us what we should know and what we shouldn't. I want to be accountable for what I believe and what I know. I don't want someone else to tell me the things I should know that are right and the things that I should know that are wrong. If I get something wrong, I'll get it wrong and I'll accept the consequences. I don't want to rely on Wikipedia (which is really just one person who wrote the articles) or the news media for my knowledge. I don't want society to rely on one person's biases for information. I think people should go out there and research for information themselves instead.

So what can you do? Whenever you want to know about a particular topic or event, just research it yourself. Find information, papers, talks and statistics about the event. Distinguish what is real and what is fake. Check sources for information. Ask specialists, ask people on the internet. People have trouble distinguishing the flat tone truths from real facts in the media because the people who write articles on Wikipedia and the news media have perfected the skill of telling flat out lies in the news media. You might say that there are a lot of untruths out there. Although that is true, you still can distinguish truths from lies based on what is out there. People have natural BS detectors. That's how our brains are. People don't need a condescension of a journalist or a Wikipedia editor to tell them what is right and what is wrong.
